## Exercise 2.3.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Thomas Jefferson is the first person to use more than 60 words in the dictionary. Jeffersonian words include: (a) authentication, (b) belittle, (c) indecipherable, (d) inheritability, (e) odometer, (f ) sanction, (g) vomit-grass, and (h) shag. For each Jeffersonian
word, guess its derivation and explain whether or not its meaning could be inferred from its components. 

### Solution

**Authentication**: Can be separated into components(**morphemes**) [“*authenticate*”] and [“*ion*”]. Authenticate means true or valid, -ion is a suffix denoting a condition or action. So the meaning of the new word [“Authentication”] could be inferred from the components as the act of validating.

**Belittle**: Can be separated into components(**morphemes**) [“*be*”] and [“*little*”], can be inferred to a degree- I think. To me, I take [“*be*”] as a command from someone or an act and [“*little*”]- something small. Combined it could be an act of regarding something small or with lesser value(small could mean lesser value), this is a bit close to its original meaning of regarding something or someone as unimportant.

**Indecipherable**: In-decipher-able; three components(**morphemes**). [“*Able*”] here means ability, [“*decipher*”]- to read and [“*-in*”] as a prefix could mean [“*in, on or not*”]. In this case, not is the only reasonable meaning. Therefore, the new word Indecipherable could be inferred as not able to read-(a combination of the definitions of the components).

**Odometer**: When sifted will produce components [“*Odo*”] and [“*meter*”]. [“*Odo*”] is one of those words that are just used and don’t really have meanings, but we could still get an idea of what odometer means from the second component [“*meter*”]- meaning distance or instrument used in measuring distance, and probably with experience of other words bearing meter. For example barometer, speedometer. However, we may not get the full meaning.

**Sanction**: Can be filtered to produce [“*sanct*”] and [“*-ion*”]. The prefix ***-ion*** was talked about earlier , but the other word sanct is a Latin word, and so it could be hard guessing the meaning of this new word or maybe impossible as the word sanct itself means holy and is not in any way relating to punishment or penalty which is the meaning of sanction.

**Vomit-grass**: I feel this is a figurative expression, that could mean spewing out thoughts or feelings that have been kept in one for a considerable amount of time and then trying to think through them, maybe one at a time; from the concept of ruminant animals that have four chambers of the stomach and after having chewed a lot of grass initially and are settled they spew it out as start rechewing in bits, in a relaxed mode. I haven’t seen this word in any dictionary yet.

**Shag**: This is primitive. Cannot be inferred from split components because it’s in it’s smallest meaningful unit.
