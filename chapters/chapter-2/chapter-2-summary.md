# Chapter 2 summary

 Language is a tool for communication, probably the most common. Language is used to communicate between:
 
 1. Two humans or more.
 
 2. A network of computers.
 
 3. A human and a computer.
 
 4. And I like to think between animals too.
 
 ## 2.1 Surface Forms and Meanings.
 
A language is a set of surface forms and meanings, and a mapping between the surface forms and their associated meanings.

Surface forms could be characters, pictures ...And the rest.

For example a baby is communicated with mostly with pictures and videos, :coffee: <= could mean tea time. So a language is all about
passing a message.

In the earliest of years when civilization was still at it's minimal, surface forms were sounds-if you watch documentaries or NatGeoWild you would have seen some of these surface forms as some native communities still use these communication styles in hunting.

There are a whole lot of surface forms some of which are  drum beats,pictures, or hand gestures(for those that are familiar with soccer, an offside refree indicates an offside by stretching forth his flag- comunicating to the refree).

**Natural Language**: spoken by humans is very complex and evolves as time goes on.

In computing the surface forms focus are text which is in a linear sequence of characters.
**String** is the name given to these set of characters.***string*** is a sequence of zero or more characters which is drawn from a finite set of characters known as ***alphabet*** {a,b,...,k,...,z}.

#### In ***strings*** capital letters, numerals and punctuation marks are also needed.

Communication systems involving humans are imprecise and would vary based on the interpretation of the interpreter(human that is being communicated with). Mr Y and Mrs U may disagree on the actual meaning of :coffee:, Mr Y may take it as coffee and Mrs U as tea.

Communication systems for computers demand precision: we want to know what our programs will do, so it is important
that every step they make is understood precisely and unambiguously.

In Computing a useful language must be able to express *infinitely* many different meanings-must be able to generate new surface forms([strings]) and guess their meanings.
