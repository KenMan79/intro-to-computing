# Chapter 1 summary

There are two reasons why everyone should study computing:

1. Nearly all of the most exciting and important technologies, arts, and sciences of today and tomorrow are driven by computing.

2. Understanding computing illuminates deep insights and questions in the nature of our minds, our culture, and our universe.

## 1.1 Processes, procedures and computers.

Computers can mechanize any intellectual activity we can imagine. 

Computer science is the study of information processes. A process is a sequence of steps. 

A **procedure** is a description of a process.A simple process can be described just by listing the steps. The list of the steps is the procedure; the act of following them is the process. A procedure that can be followed without any thought is called a mechanical 

For example, baking a cake or mailing a letter would both be processes. However, they involve physical things like sugar or paper, while computer science focuses on processes that involve abstract information rather than physical things.  

Here’s an example of a procedure (or a recipe) for baking a cake:
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. F.
2. Butter a cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper
3. Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. 
4. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

...And so on.

Describing processes just by listing steps like this has limitations. Natural languages are imprecise and ambiguous. We assume that whoever follows these instructions knows many things. For example, we assume the oven is plugged in and sitting on a flat surface.

We could add as many details as we can to our above procedure, but the English language (and many others) is inherently vague. 

Another problem with this way of describing a procedure is that the size of the description is proportional to the # of steps in the process. This is fine for simple processes that can be executed by humans in a reasonable amount of time, but the processes we want to execute on computers involve trillions of steps. 

To program computers, we need tools that allow us to describe processes precisely. For a machine to carry out a procedure, every step needs to be described. Computers can’t rely on “common sense” (for example, knowing to turn on the oven). We need mechanical procedures that can be followed without any thinking.

A computer is a machine that can:

Accept input. Input could be a human typing into keyboard.
Execute a mechanical procedure, a procedure where each step can be executed without any thought.
Produce output. Output could be data displayed to humans. 

Computers exist in many forms, but we’ll focus on universal computers, which are computers that can perform all possible mehanical computations on discrete inputs except for practical limits on space and time. If this sounds confusing to you, we’ll learn more about this later on! :)

We need computers that can not only perform mechanical procedures, but do so fast. There is where ‘computing power’ comes in, a term you may have heard of.

## 1.2 Measuring Computing Power.

We can measure the power of a computing machine in two ways:

How much information can it process?
How fast can it process?

Let’s consider this first question. 

When we think about information, we usually mean knowledge. At the smallest level in the computer, information is stored as bits and bytes. 

What are bits and bytes?

A bit is the smallest unit of information that can be stored by a computer.

Eight bits grouped together is a byte.
