## 1.1 Processes, procedures and computers.

Compter science is the study of information processes. 

A process is a sequence of steps. For example, baking a cake or mailing a letter would both be processes. However, they involve physical things like sugar or paper, while computer science focuses on processes that involve abstract information rather than physical things. 

A procedure is a description of a process.A simple process can be described just by listing the steps. The list of the steps is the procedure; the act of following them is the process.
